       "\"Hello friends. Ah today, we are going to uhdiscuss about ah crystal planes and directions, ah how we can index them ah and in hexagonal system cubic system and so on and what is the procedure of indexing . So, basically if you want to make a uh a can, for example, beverage cans the Coca-Cola or Pepsi cans which you use are all deep drawing ah made by deep drawing operation and .  There will be because there are different type of deformation at different part of the cup, ah you will have thinning of material at certain point and at another point there will be a thick sheet . So, which is not a good thing and we will not be able to design any of our part properly if there is thickness difference .  In bcc materials or bcc crystals, 1 0 0 direction is the easy magnetization direction; that means, you can easily have magnetization and you can understand 50 times, it has to .magnetize demagnetize . So, with each cycle, there will be a hysteresis loop and for in each hystereresis . loop, there is loss of ah energy ok. So, there are losses in the in the distribution .  Some planes and directions are preferred or where the deformation actually takes place in those particular planes in a particular direction . So that my losses can be minimized and of course, heating of the transformer can also be minimized ok . So, that uh is what is this particular lecture is about how to index planes and direction .  William Miller in 1839, he proposed a system how you can index, these planes and directions . He said u v w can be the name and if you enclose them in a square bracket like which is shown here, then it will be ah direction that is shown .  A cubic crystal is a unit cell of a cubic crystal and a cubic cubic crystal . So, any vector which is passing through a coordinate point, let us say u v w, is a vector r . Principal directions will be along a, b and c, and principal directions are x, v, v and v .  If a vector or direction is not starting or passing through the origin, you reposition it to find its projection lengths . This is how you can give the indexing that if this is the u v w, then my indexing of this particular direction is given . So, in the next slide, I will give you this algorithm for indexing this .  Miller suggested that you can have integers instead of fractions . So, the fractions will be converted to lowest-in-integer values by multi-plying by a common factor . Whatever you get you will be enclosed in a square bracket u v w without commas . The algorithm for this is the whole algorithm for finding out the direction .  Ake the unit cell here for a cubic crystal ok, we will take mostly the example of cubic crystals . So, again as we saw that you have to do see that how I am going in these 3 different directions ok . You just want to understand whether , how . how I can do the . indexing of this particular . direction .  The indexing of this particular direction is 0 1 1 ok . So, let us say, we take another complicated and by the way, this is this particular one is called face diagonal . For this, for this I have I cannot go in a direction . I will be going in b direction ok, one unit is one unit and I will reach there .  The indexing will be 1 1 1 and this is what we call as body diagonal . So, I will be going one unit in a direction one unit of a direction, one in b direction one in c direction and one in all direction. So, let us see if we have fraction instead of unit length.  The common factor here is 2 if I multiply the whole thing by 2 ok, then I can get rid of this fraction here . So, fraction also you can easily handle whatever you do not like fractions . The thing you have to remember is that it has to be for the whole calculation. It should be the you should get the lowest integers .  The path we have to trace that is what we are seeing here . So, in all these cases we have gone negative negative negative . The from from from origin start of the . direction to the end of the direction we have . to that to reach that to . the end point. So, how to write this?  There can be even multiple ways of finding out the direction of a plane in multiple directions to find out the indexing for there we will do the assignments . So, if you have a if you are going . along a negative direction then you have to put bar one bar . one bar one to get the direction. e this I will put bar over the number if it is negative one .  We will take reciprocal of the intercepts after taking the reciprocal if there are any discrepancies . If plane is passing through the origin, then we will have a problem because we cannot have an intercept, then you can take a parallelplane of that particular plane or you can shift the origin itself keeping the sense of crystal axis .  The intercepts on the ah on this particular ah directions are at infinity . So, if I want to write the intercepts in case of a there is no intercept, there will be no intercept on c . The intercept is at infinity because both the plane and the direction of the plane are different .  This is why we are taking reciprocalhere in case of planes ok because we again do not like uh this concept of infinity . So, the the business of taking this reciprocal in the case of plane is just to get rid of this infinity . This infinity becomes 0; obviously, one will remain one and again this infinity becomes0 .  The plane is a parallel plane to this, but the problem is it is passing through origin now how to find out the intercept . So, very quickly you can do very quickly that if I want to know for this plane we have already seen, let me again draw ahophobic another plane like this .  The origin is arbitrary and you can put origin anywhere at this point . So, let us say I I am not happy with this origin I have put the origin at this lattice point, but as I told you in the ah last ah ah statement here that I will still keep the same direction .  The idea is to find the indexing of some of the important planes like cubic crystal because that is what is going to come later on . So, let us say, I am interested in a plane like this, it is going like this a plane, it will be infinity minus one and then I will take the reciprocal .  The intercepts are parallel to the a axis, so intercept at the a will be at infinity . So, intercepts at the b will be 1 in the b . One intercept of 1 in c. will be 0 1 1 in a plane like this . We will take the reciprocal of these values . You are getting the fractions here .  There is another concept called family of directions and family of planes . So, for example, we said this crystal x is a, b and a, a, p and a and p direction . We will take the reciprocal first and multiply by that common factor to get the integer values here .  The family of direction is shown by a family of directions . The length of each of this vector is the length of the vector they are a part of the same family . So, to represent this, I can represent this whole thing you I do not have to write it like this . It represents all the six directions you have shown .  For for a property it does not matter whether it is 1 0 0, 0 1 0 or 0 0 0 1, all are same . So, I can just represent them by a family of directions . Similarly, in case of planes also we can represent planes as positive directions with origin .  Plane indexing will be given as h k i l where I is related to h and k like this, I is equal to minus of h plus k and direction will be u v  direction . Plane indices will be like this and plane indexing is a 4 index system . Plane distances is inter atomic distances is same for all these planes .  Instead of following 3 indexing system we will follow the 4 index system . So, ah now the question is why why why we want to uh do this kind of thing? So, let us see if you have ah we do do not follow this Miller-Bravais system, we will still follow the older the one which we have already discussed .  The indexing for this particular plane will be it is parallel to 0 ah a 1 direction cutting a 2 at one and a 2 direction cutting at one . So, there is it it is going to cut at infinity you taking reciprocal will give me the indexing is 0 ok . Now, you compare this with the our cube one ok .  These are all prismatic planes have the same indexing system but when I use the 3 indexing . system . They were showing different indexing systems . That means, there is some problem here ok . That problem can be rectified if I find out the intercept in all the 3 direction all the 4 directions .  In a it will be 0 a 2 a here a 1 at the negative ok , but now we will consider the third one also a 3 it is parallel to a 3, you can see this particular plane is parallel . So, for this one I will write it is bar 1 one 0 0 .  The indexing remains same as we have already seen in the earlier case . So, if you want to draw different planes in the hexagonal system, you can't do that for example, this ah you have to start drawing quickly ok . Having different indexing for the same type of plane they all now look similar to to each other .  We are interested in a plane like this ok. 2 here a 1 here and let us say it is making an intercept here . So, maybe something like this is like this? So, if you do a little bit trigonometry here you will find out that it is cutting at half of the plane. So, in terms of ah the how the how to write this .  There are some funny things which are happening here, for example, if you try to follow the what we did in case of . indexing system for planes . For example, when we were using Miller indexing . system it was given like this where 1 0 0 for a to be it was uh 0 ah0 1 0 c, it was 0 0 1 0 . But it is not like that actually if you see in the . process the a 1 is 2 bar 1 bar 1 0 that that that is the indexing. That means, that means, 'I have to go 2 units'  There are relations which are given here to do the indexing system . So, every time to find out that how to go in all these 3 . or all in this 4 . indexing . system becomes very difficult . so, what we do is we do it in 3 indexing systems and then we convert it into 4 . indexes .  2, this is a 3 ok let us suppose we index a 1 using the worth ah 3 indexing system . So, sorry, a 3 I draw wrongly a 3 will go here . A 1 will be 1 0 0 . From that system it will be 0 0 the u v. w w is w is 0 because the last one is 0 .  The 0 1 0 0 the a 1 x is should be 2 bar 1 bar 1 0 ok and this you can do for any direction . So, in 3 indexing system I will write this in the negative a 1 direction . Negative a to c will give you get me to the end point of this particular direction .  U is 1 by 3 2 u minus v is 2 minus one minus 0.0 and that comes to minus 2 by 3 ok v is equal to again one by 3 it is minus u . So, for this one ah I will be ah to starting from a 1 direction then a 2 and then c .  Indexing system will be in 3 indexing system it will be ah positive in a 1 positive one . Then again a 2 positive one and in c, again a . positive one, again again, again in c. s, then I will be going along this to get to the final point ok . So, let us write it there it is 1 by 3 minus 2 by 3 . Then t will be equal to minus of u plus. of u .  A 3 apositive is this direction . So, a 2 negative of that will be ah. So, 2 negative in a 3 . A 2 negative will be that direction . A 3 negative is this way . A 1 negative is a negative . A negative is 2 negative .  If we understand that we will be able to do a good job of indexing and direction . And you will start getting the ah ah picture or visualization of the ah when we say certain plane. e and ah ah . So, thank you very much for the your patience .\""

      "\n",
      "In micro machining, the challenges associated with tool wear and burr formation are significant due to the small dimensions and high precision requirements of the parts being machined.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tool wear**: Tool wear in micro machining is more severe than in conventional machining because of the increased contact area between the tool and the workpiece, and the smaller dimensions of the tool. Tool wear can lead to an increase in machining forces, errors in part dimensions, and reduced tool life.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Adhesive wear**: This type of wear occurs when the tool and workpiece materials adhere to each other due to high contact pressures. This leads to material transfer from the workpiece to the tool, which can affect the tool's cutting edge and reduce its effectiveness.\n",
      "   - **Abrasion wear**: This type of wear is caused by the erosion of the tool material due to the presence of hard particles in the workpiece or cutting fluid. This can lead to a blunting of the tool's cutting edge and an increase in tool wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Burr formation**: Burrs are small protrusions that form on the edges of the machined part due to the deformation of the material during the machining process. In micro machining, burrs can be particularly problematic due to the small dimensions of the parts and the need for high precision. Burrs can interfere with the assembly of the parts, and they can also cause stress concentrations that can lead to part failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategies or technologies to mitigate tool wear and burr formation**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use of hard and wear-resistant materials**: Tools made from hard and wear-resistant materials, such as diamond or cubic boron nitride, can reduce tool wear and improve tool life. These materials have a higher resistance to adhesive and abrasive wear than conventional tool materials.\n",
      "2. **Use of lubricants**: Lubricants can reduce tool wear by reducing the friction between the tool and the workpiece, and by preventing the adhesion of workpiece material to the tool.\n",
      "3. **Use of ultrasonic vibration**: Ultrasonic vibration can be used to improve the cutting efficiency and reduce tool wear by increasing the rate of material removal. This is because the high-frequency vibration can help to break up the workpiece material and reduce the contact area between the tool and the workpiece.\n",
      "4. **Use of laser-assisted machining**: Laser-assisted machining can be used to reduce tool wear and burr formation by melting the workpiece material and reducing the contact area between the tool and the workpiece. This can also improve the quality of the machined surface by reducing the amount of heat generated during the machining process.\n",
      "5. **Use of micro-grinding**: Micro-grinding can be used to remove burrs and improve the surface finish of the machined part. This process involves the use of a small grinding wheel or abrasive particle to remove the burrs and improve the surface finish.\n",
      "6. **Use of post-processing techniques**: Post-processing techniques, such as electropolishing or chemical etching, can be used to remove burrs and improve the surface finish of the machined part. These techniques can be particularly useful for parts that require a high level of precision and a smooth surface finish.\n"
